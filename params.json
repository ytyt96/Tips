This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.\r\n* Bill Split functionality added. \r\n\r\n## Video Walkthrough \r\n\r\nHere's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:\r\n\r\n<img src='http://i.imgur.com/e1G3Baf.gif' title='Video Walkthrough' width='' alt='Video Walkthrough' />\r\n\r\nGIF created with [LiceCap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nSince this is my first iOS and Swift app, my focus is simply to try some of the features proviede by iOS and Swift. As a result, I haven't spent time improving the UI, but I do have tried to make the app as intuitive as possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, though the app looks generally good on old iPhone screen size, the app layout does not fit the bigger screens in iPhone 6, which is the issue I have not resolved.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Copyright [2015] [Yuting Zhang]\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n        http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n",
